        <p>Welcome your home escape room experience!</p>
        <p>This webapp allows you to create and run an Escape Room in your own home.</p>
        <p>Start by clicking <code>...</code> at the bottom of the screen and then the <code>Edit</code> button.</p>
        <p>A game consists of stages, which has the screen text that is displayed, and an exit code that must be displayed to advance to the next stage. Each stage will also have one or more clues that help the players discover the exit code. These clues are intended to be hidden around the house.</p>
        <p>Clues have the text and the location printed on them so that you know where to hide them. You can print a clue sheet by clicking <code>Clue Sheet</code> at the bottom of the screen.</p>
        <p>Start the game by clicking on the <code>Play</code> button at the bottom of the screen. The game can be reset by clicking the <code>Reset</code> button at the top of the screen. The timer can be paused by clicking it.</p>
        <p>An example game has been populated if you have not loaded one already. Games can be loaded and saved in the Edit screen using the <code>Export</code> and <code>Import</code> buttons.</p>
        <p>This app is hosted on Github. Check out the project <a href="https://github.com/tvStatic/escapeStartist">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>
